# Public Irish Nursing Home Data Analysis

This repository houses data analysis scripts regarding Irish nursing home data publicly available online. Processing is done to generation visualisations based on nursing home costs, locations, distances from hospitals and general elderly populations in each county. All html-based interactive graphs can be accessed via the 'html_pages' directory. 

## Findings 

###Â Distances From Hospitals

- The majority of Irish nursing homes are at 'dangerous' distances from hospital; these distance findings are inspired by research undertaken by [Nicholl et al.](https://doi.org/10.1136%2Femj.2007.047654) regarding mortality rates and distances from hospitals. 
- Palliative care interventions focusing on quality as opposed to quantity of life may be beneficial in homes whereby distressing hospital transfers have poor outcomes.

### Private vs Public Nursing Homes 
- There are far more private than public nursing homes
- Expenditure per person in private facilities seem to cost less than public facilities. 
- Lower costs and more attractive services may incentivize more people to go to private nursing homes, which do not operate under [HSE](https://www.hse.ie/) standards or regulations. 
- While [HIQUA](https://www.hiqa.ie/) ensures both types of nursing home are regulated, a drive for higher care standards makes standardisation difficult in private Irish nursing homes.
- Similarities between types of care across the majority of nursing homes are difficult in Ireland.
