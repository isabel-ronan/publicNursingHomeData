1.	The person in charge is employed on a full time basis and is supernumerary to the nurses who are delivering direct care to the residents;2.	There is one registered nurse rostered to work between both buildings,  the House and The Lodge,  which comprise and are within the footprint of the designated centre between 0800hrs and 1700hrs seven days a week to support the staff in each building that make up the designated centre   (this role may be inclusive of the Director of Nursing role set out in the Statement of Purpose but is exclusive of the role of Person in Charge);3.	In addition to the nursing resources set out in 1 and 2 above there is a minimum of one registered nurse working exclusively (a total of 2 nurses) in each building (the House and the Lodge) 24 hours a day,  seven days a week.
The above minimum levels of nursing staff does not preclude the registered provider from increasing these numbers if the dependency levels or care needs of residents increase such that these minimum numbers of nurses are insufficient to meet the needs of all residents living in the designated centre.Condition 5At a minimum the registered provider will ensure that each day there are sufficient numbers of health care assistants present and working in the designated centre as follows;
1.	There are a minimum of ten health care assistants working in the designated centre (two between 0700hrs and 1900hrs and eight between 0800 hrs and 2000hrs) each day,  seven days a week; 2.

The staffing numbers set out in points 1 and 2 of this Condition 5 exclude any additional contracted and/or agreed one to one care hours for individual residents. Such care hours must be resourced in addition to the above minimum numbers of health care assistants.  The registered provider is required to ensure that staff rosters for the designated centre reflect these hours separately to the baseline staffing requirements set out at 1 and 2 above.

It is proposed to vary this condition to reflect changes to the Statement of Purpose and the Floor Plans made by the provider to achieve compliance with SI 293 and to protect residents from the risk of fire.  As a consequence of these changes no more than 4 residents are now accommodated in any single bedroom which also means that there are less residents availing of the available communal space and toilet facilities.  In addition the changes also mean that there are less residents residing in identified fire compartments ensuring speedier evacuation times can be achieved by the available staff.Condition 2Only persons aged 18 years or older shall be accommodated at the designated centre at any time.Condition 3The maximum number of persons that may be accommodated at the designated centre is: 45.",https://www.hiqa.ie/areas-we-work/find-a-centre/st-columbas-hospital
